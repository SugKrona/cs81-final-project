#### Project Overview - 
This project is an very simple quick interactive web application that simulates a jousting tournament between four themed houses. I first started with wanting to make a personality quiz like the ones they make to pick a house in Harry Potter, but then my mind drifted to a memory of me at the renaissance fair 2 months ago and my favorite moment was the Jousting, being able to cheer for a house and a knight. So my goal then was to build an engaging and immersive experience that allows a user to select a house and run a full tournament simulation, complete with randomized challenges, a final battle, and a detailed results screen. Every part of the application was designed to be clear, responsive, and fun to use.

#### Project Features - 
* **House Selection**: The user begins by choosing from one of four unique houses, each with its own "lore" , knight, and squire.
* **Dynamic Tournament**: The simulation progresses through three rounds of challenges, with scores updating automatically after each round.
* **Final Battle**: The bottom two houses get eliminated and the top two houses face off in a dramatic final battle to determine the ultimate champion.
* **Immersive Audio**: The app features a main background theme, a special jingle that plays during loading screens, and a selection sound that provides instant feedback every time a button is pressed as well as a crowd cheeering for the victor.
* **Comprehensive Results**: The final results screen not only celebrates the winner but also includes a tribute to the fallen knight.
* **Restart Functionality**: The entire simulation can be reset with a single button click from the results screen.

#### Technologies Used - 
* **React**: to build the user interface and manage the application's state.
* **JavaScript, HTML, & CSS**: core programming languages used to code the project.
* **React Hooks**: `useState` and `useEffect` were used to manage the application's data and control side effects like audio playback.
* **Custom Assets**: The project uses custom font files, image assets for characters and shields, and custom cursor files.
* **Vite**: The build tool used to set up the development environment.

#### How to Play
1.  **Open the App**: Simply go to the application's website (localhost:5173)
2.  **Choose Your House**: Select one of the four houses to represent in the tournament.
3.  **Start the Challenges**: Follow the on-screen prompts and click the "Start Challenge" buttons to progress through the rounds.
4.  **View the Winner**: See which house is crowned champion of the tournament!
